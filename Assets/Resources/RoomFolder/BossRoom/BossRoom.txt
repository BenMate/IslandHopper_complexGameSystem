Place A 'Boss Room' Prefab Inside this Folder, Attached the 'Dungeon room' Script and it will Add it to a list to be used inside the Dungeon Generator.

Note:
The database script will only find prefabs with the correct scripts attached.
The Boss Room will generate when there are no more rooms connected to it.
If you enable dead ends and the ability to have more then one boss room, all dead ends will become boss rooms.
